          <div id="document-content" class="document">Leo was a boy who liked looking closely at things. One sunny afternoon, the birds were singing, and a gentle breeze stirred the leaves. &#34;It&#39;s a good day for a walk,&#34; Leo thought. He went out the back door and started down the dusty path that led into the small woods behind his house.

The sunlight made patterns on the ground. Leo kicked a small pebble and watched it skitter away. He looked at the tall trees and the moss growing on an old log. As he walked, his eyes caught a little sparkle near the edge of the path.

He bent down. Partially hidden under a leaf was a stone. It wasn&#39;t like the other rough pebbles. This one was smooth and grey, with tiny flecks that glittered when the light hit them just right. It felt cool and solid in his hand. Leo smiled. He put the special stone carefully into his pocket and continued his walk, happy with his small discovery.</div>
