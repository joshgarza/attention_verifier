    print("!!! Implement attention processing logic in src/attention_processor.py !!!")
    # Steps:
    # 1. Understand the structure of attention_weights (e.g., tuple of layer tensors: (batch, head, query_seq, key_seq))
    # 2. Identify which parts of the attention correspond to:
    #    - Attention FROM answer tokens
    #    - Attention TO document tokens
    #    (This requires knowing the token indices for prompt vs. answer)
    # 3. Decide on an aggregation strategy:
    #    - Which layers/heads to use? (e.g., last layer, average, specific heads?)
    #    - How to aggregate scores onto document tokens? (e.g., sum/max attention received from answer tokens)
    # 4. Map aggregated token scores back to character spans in `document_text`.
    #    - This is non-trivial due to subword tokenization. You'll need `tokenizer.decode` or offset mapping.
    # 5. Extract and rank the text spans with the highest aggregated attention.
